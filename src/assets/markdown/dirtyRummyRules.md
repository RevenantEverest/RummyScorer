## What is Dirty Rummy?

Dirty rummy is an addition of traditional Rummy to add new exciting elements to the game. Per round, you're given a 4 actions witch can shakeup the round.

## Available Actions

### Switch Hands

Switch your current hand with another players. You cannot revert this action if their hand is worse than the hand you gave them.

### Steal Meld

Steal any meld currently placed by another player. Once the meld has been stolen, the points count towards whoever stole the meld. This action also ***locks*** in the meld, preventing it from being stolen by other players. If multiple players try to steal the same meld at the same time, they play a round of Rock, Paper, Scissors to determine who is awarded the stolen meld.

### Re-Draw Hand

Within the first turn, re draw all the cards in your hand and place the now discarded cards at the bottom of the face down pick up pile.

### Go Fish

Pick a player and ask them for a single number or face card. If that player has the requested card, they must give it to you. If they do not, then you gain no new cards and the action is still spent.
